[![CI](https://github.com/neverhuman/jankurai-tools-analyzers/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/neverhuman/jankurai-tools-analyzers/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Dimension analyzers and scoring suite for the **jankurai** audit standard. This
repository is one member of the Jankurai split family; read [`SPLIT.md`](SPLIT.md)
for the family contract and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for agent routing rules.

## Contributor setup

This repository supplies native language, web-security and repository-health detectors to
[Jankurai](https://github.com/neverhuman/jankurai). For binary installation,
your first audit, and the complete family build, start at the hub.

Install Rust **1.97.1**, a native compiler/linker and Node.js **24** for CI
control tests. Then run the crate's contributor checks:

```sh
cargo fetch --locked
cargo test --workspace --locked
bash scripts/ci-local.sh required
```

The native library does not need Node.js at runtime. The complete quality lane
also needs the pinned security tools and auditor installed by the owning CI
setup; see [testing](docs/testing.md) and
[the workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Local recipes are in the
[Justfile](Justfile).
